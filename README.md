# Containers and Orchestrators Exam

The project consists of a web application in C, packaged in Docker and deployed in Kubernetes. The web server listens on port 8080 and responds with a basic message. A "Dockerfile" is used to build the container and three Kubernetes configuration files ("deployment.yaml", "service.yaml", and "ingress.yaml") are used to deploy it to the cluster. The Ingress allows access to the application through different routes.
